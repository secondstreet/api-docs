# Creating/Sending a <br>Single Message Campaign

# Group Creating/Sending a <br>Single Message Campaign
In order to send a ```single_message_campaign```, the following steps must be done. These steps will layout how to create and send a `single_message_campaign` that has `html` as the body of the message.

**Steps**
1. [Create Message Campaign](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-message-campaign-post)
2. [Get Single Message Campaign](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-get)
3. [Create New Message Campaign Audience](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-message-campaign-audience-post)
4. [Create New Message Version](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-message-version-post)
5. [Update Single Message Campaign](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-put)

::: note
## Message Campaign Preset
When posting to create a `message campaign`, be sure to use:
```http
message_campaign_preset_id: 1
```
:::
::: warning
#### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Caution
If the value of `message_campaign_preset_id` is not `1`, the steps described within will not work properly.

In our example, the `id` URI Parameter value of `2273` was the `id` returned from [Step 1](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-message-campaign-post).
::: note
## The RESPONSE
Two attributes whose values will be used in later calls:
```http
id: 2273
message_id: 2467
```
:::

<!-- include(../endpoints/single_message_campaigns/get.apib) -->

<!-- include(../endpoints/message_campaign_audiences/endpoint.apib) -->

::: note
The `message_campaign_id` is obtained from the RESPONSE of the `message_campaign` POST.  The `audience_id` would have already been acquired.

<!-- include(../endpoints/message_versions/endpoint.apib) -->

This step is where the actual email is created.

<!-- include(../endpoints/message_versions/post.apib) -->

<!-- include(../endpoints/single_message_campaigns/endpoint.apib) -->

This step is where the email is scheduled and saved as ready to send.  For a `single_message_campaign` the `message_campaign_type_id` will always be `1` and `schedule_type_id` and `message_sending_status_type_id` will also be `1`.  `is_scheduled` will also be set to TRUE.
