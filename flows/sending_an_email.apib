::: note
## Message Campaign Preset
When posting to create a `message campaign`, be sure to use:
```http
message_campaign_preset_id: 1
```

#### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Caution
If the value of `message_campaign_preset_id` is not `1`, the steps described within will not work properly.

In our example, the `id` URI Parameter value of `2273` was the `id` returned from [Step 1](#creating-sending-a-message-campaign-message-campaign-post).
::: note
## The RESPONSE
Two attributes whose values will be used in later calls:
```http
id: 2273
message_id: 2467
```
:::

<!-- include(../endpoints/single_message_campaigns/get.apib) -->

<!-- include(../endpoints/message_campaign_audiences/endpoint.apib) -->

::: note
The `message_campaign_id` is obtained from the RESPONSE of the `message_campaign` POST.  The `audience_id` would have already been acquired.
