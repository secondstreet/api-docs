2. [Get Single Message Campaign](#creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-get)
3. [Create New Message Campaign Audience](#creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-message-campaign-audience-post)

::: note
## Message Campaign Preset
When posting to create a `message campaign`, be sure to use the following which creates a Single-Email campaign:
```http
message_campaign_preset_id: 1
```
:::
::: warning
#### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Caution
If the value of `message_campaign_preset_id` is not `1`, the steps described within will not work properly.

<h3 id="creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-get">Step 2: Get Single Message Campaign</h3>

<div class="action"><h4 class="action-heading"><div class="name"></div><a href="#creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-get" class="method get">GET</a><code class="uri">/single_message_campaigns/{id}</code></h4></div>

In our GET example below, the `id` URI Parameter value of `2273` (the Id of the `message campaign`) was the `id` returned from [Step 1](#creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-message-campaign-post).

::: note
## The RESPONSE
Two attributes from the GET below whose values will be used in later calls:
```http
id: 2273
message_id: 2467
```

<h3 id="creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-message-campaign-audience-post">Step 3: Create New Message Campaign Audience</h3>

::: note
The `message_campaign_id` is obtained from the RESPONSE of the `message_campaign` POST.  The `audience_id` would have already been acquired.

<h3 id="creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-message-version-post">Step 4: Create New Message Version</h3>

This step is where the actual email is created.

<!-- include(../endpoints/single_message_campaigns/endpoint.apib) -->

<h3 id="creating-sending-a-br-single-message-campaign-single-message-campaign-put">Step 5: Update Single Message Campaign</h3>

This step is where the email is scheduled and saved as ready to send.  For a `single_message_campaign` the `message_campaign_type_id` will always be `1` and `schedule_type_id` and `message_sending_status_type_id` will also be `1`.  `is_scheduled` will also be set to TRUE.
